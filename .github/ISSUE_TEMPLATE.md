# Important:

MetaCPAN has a few active developers, who want to focus on fixing bugs
and improving the existing core system.

For this reason if you have a feature you would like to see added
(there are load's we would love to have), please open an issue IF you
are prepared to do the work to impliment it.

Otherwise please add it to our [wishlist](https://github.com/CPAN-API/cpan-api/wiki/Wishlist) and someone may get to it one day.

For more details on issues and contributing please see [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md).
